# svg-icon

Simple and flexible &lt;svg-icon>, built with HTML Custom Elements (HTMLElement).

### Why &lt;svg-icon> ?

1. Web Component - Works in any web framework and for any purpose.
2. Simple - Optimized for quick and straightforward design and development experience.
3. Flexible - Everything is customizable.


### Features

1. `src` - By default, it fetches icons from `/icons`, but you can override this by setting the src attribute.
2. `name` - Use `folder/icon-name` or simply `icon-name` as a value.
3. `size` - The default size is 24px, but you can override this by setting the size attribute or with your CSS.
4. `color` - Icons' fills are set by default to the font's inherited color (thanks to svg-inject), therefore can be overridden using plain CSS selectors with `font-color` or `color` properties.
